## The Book of Kane

These mindless ramblings were written with the blood of timberwolves beside an open flame. By studying these markings carefully, you might impart new knowledge onto your fellow human beings. The scrawling on these sheets was imparted to humans by Oden on top of the always-snow-covered ProtoMountains in the far North. Do not stare directly at the words or you shall experience lucid nightmares for a fortnight.
