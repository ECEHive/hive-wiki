title: Phone Case Engraving Workshop
---

One of the Hive's most popular workshops is the phone case laser engraving workshop. At this workshop, we will first cover the basics of Adobe Illustrator. You will then use the software to create your own engraving design, incorporating any graphics, text, and photographs you want. Finally, you can engrave your phone case using the laser cutters on the first floor of the Hive. Peer instructors (PIs) will be available to help you create your design and engrave your phone case. 

For information on upcoming laser engraving workshops, look for an announcement from the Hive's mailing list or visit the events calendar on [the Hive's website](https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/).
