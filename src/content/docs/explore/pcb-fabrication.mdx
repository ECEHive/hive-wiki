:::note
**The electroplater is no longer officially supported by The Hive.** It still exists, and you can still use it (after the training sequence), but we can't guarantee quality to our standards as longer, given the maintenance requirements and the user base. To make vias in our no-plating process, make any vias as 1mm-diameter holes (excluding the annular ring), and then solder in a standard header pin. 
:::

Here at The Hive, we have a suite of tools made by LPKF that enable students to fabricate printed circuit boards (PCBs). Students go through a three-step training process to gain access to the tools, after which they can use the equipment and our materials free of charge whenever The Hive is open.

There are three primary pieces of equipment used in this process:

- The LPKF ProtoMat S103 - a 2.5-dimensional plotter that drills and mills (cuts) PCB substrates, plastics, and soft metals
- The LPKF ProtoLaser U4 - a 20um-diameter laser to etch (selectively remove) a wide variety of film/substrate pairings
- The LPKF Contac S4 - a semi-automatic galvanic electroplater for via formation and other copper/tin plating needs. **The electroplater works, but the quality is no longer guaranteed by The Hive, and we are actively suggesting that students look for alternative options, such as 1mm through-holes or no-via designs.**

We also can [cut stencils](https://wiki.hive.ece.gatech.edu/doku.php?id=process_stencils) from polyamide or PET sheets (for stainless, see the laser cutting area), and assemble boards with a [reflow oven](https://wiki.hive.ece.gatech.edu/doku.php?id=process_reflowoven). We also have a few unsupported capabilities, including applying [soldermask](https://www.lpkfusa.com/datasheets/prototyping/promask.pdf) and [silkscreen](https://www.lpkfusa.com/datasheets/prototyping/prolegend.pdf), a less-complicated [psuedo-masking process](https://wiki.hive.ece.gatech.edu/doku.php?id=process_kaptonmask), as well as a [chemical-free electroplating process](https://www.lpkfusa.com/datasheets/prototyping/ProConduct_Specs.pdf), but again, your mileage may vary with these. Head to our [PCB fabrication](https://wiki.hive.ece.gatech.edu/doku.php?id=pcb-fab) page for more details.

The Hive provides double-sided copper on FR4 in 0.5 oz/ft^2 (18 um) and 1 oz/ft^2 (35 um) weights to our users at no cost, though many other substrates can be used.

***We are no longer requiring training for the ProtoMat or ProtoLaser***. A detailed guidebook for how to fabricate PCBs using the two tools is located at the ProtoMat. Stencil fabrication information can be found in the guidebook at the ProtoLaser.
