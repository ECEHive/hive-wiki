title: Electronics Benchtop
---

The IDC contains a suite of electronics benchtop equipment available to all end users.

Each standard station includes an:

- Oscilloscope
- Function generator
- Multimeter
- Power supply
- Soldering station, complete with a soldering iron and desoldering tool.

When you check out a station, you gain access to drawers with additional hand tools, such as tweezers, wire cutters, and screw drivers, to help you in your project.

Beginner guides on to use each piece of equipment are listed below:

- [Oscilloscope guide](/hive-wiki/guides/benchtop-oscilloscope)
- [Function generator guide](/hive-wiki/guides/benchtop-funcgen)
- [Multimeter guide](/hive-wiki/guides/benchtop-dmm)
- Power supply guide (Planned)
- Soldering guide (Planned)

In addition we also have video demos listed for all of these different pieces of equipment found here:
