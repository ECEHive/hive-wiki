## Craft Area

Ever wanted to create your own stickers, or embroider some random material? Look no further, the hive has a vinyl cutter and embroidery/sewing machine to help with any of your designs. This crafting area is located by the benchtop desks right by the stair case that leads to the bottom floor.

Our vinyl cutter is a Silhouette Cameo 3. This machine uses the computer located right next to it, and the application to use this device is called silhouette studio which is very similar to illustrator. We have anywhere from vinyl, to cardstock, and stencils for anything you want to cut with good precision.

Our sewing/embroidery machine is the Brother SE1900. You don't really need to know how to sew or embroider, as most of the process is actually computerized! We have various colors of thread for you to use and test shirts for you to practice your designs before you try it on your own material.
