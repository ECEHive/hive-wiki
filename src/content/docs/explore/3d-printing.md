title: "3D Printing"
---

The Hive currently has 12 3D printers: You can click on any hyperlink to learn about each specific printer. It links to their SOP! Printing at the hive is free, and is located in the Semi clean room. You can walk down and find a PI if you have something you would like to print. We only accept STL files and no gcode files since the PI's need to check each print. The printing system works by queue, and each printer may have a different queue. If you're not sure which printer you want to use, ask a PI! In addition to written and guided SOP's, we have a video series here that you can look at if you're a more visual learner. The videos are quick but may not be as informative: [3D Printing Video Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaHV-4SxpcHyglqhxBZvGin9r8XcTmYts&si=O4Soo1uygSNvHyco)
