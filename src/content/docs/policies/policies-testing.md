Rules and Policies 

Updated September 13, 2024 

Ratified by The Executive Board and Staff on January 9, 2024 

## Purpose of this Document

This document serves as the official collection of the rules and policies of the Interdisciplinary Design Commons (herein referred to as “The IDC,” “The Hive Makerspace,” “The Hive,” or simply, “the space”) to be adhered to by all who enter the space. These apply in addition to Georgia Tech’s official [legal](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/legal) and [campus use](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/campus-use-facilities) policies. This document may be modified at any time at the discretion of The Hive Staff and The Hive Executive Board.

    <dd class="pol-1">The Hive Staff includes the Director, Assistant Director, and any number of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) employed by the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. GTAs and UTAs operate under the authority of the Director and the Assistant Director. Staff are not considered Peer Instructors, but they have the same authorities and privileges as well as additional ones as outlined in this document.</dd>
    <dt class="pol-1">1.1.3.</dt>
    <dd class="pol-1">The Director and Assistant Director may employ, and determine at their discretion the authority of, Staff in addition to those listed in policy 1.1.2 who are not Peer Instructors.</dd>

The board shall consist of a Director of Strategy, a Director of Events, a Director of Outreach, a Director of Communications, and two Directors of Operations, each elected by the pool of active Peer Instructors from the pool of active Peer Instructors in the spring semester to serve a full year term beginning in the late summer or early fall semester. The manner of election shall be determined by Staff, and the election as a whole shall be managed by Staff. Staff may participate in Executive Board activities, such as meetings, but are not part of the board. Executive Board members need not be active Peer Instructors while serving their term but shall have all privileges of an active Peer Instructor. The Director and Assistant Director may, at their discretion, appoint additional members to the board in any existing or new position. Appointed members need not be elected.</dd>
